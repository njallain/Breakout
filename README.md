# Breakout ECS

A simple game using [SwiftECS](https://github.com/njallain/SwiftECS)

All of my posts about the development of SwfitECS can be found [here](https://bluerope.org/ecs/)

This example is way more complicated than it needs to be.  It purposefully ignores many of the nice
things that sprite kit gives you in order to demonstrate and test out SwiftECS.

As mentioned in my blog posts, I'm not a game developer.  Therefore much of this is also about me learning
how to best structure a more complicated game.
